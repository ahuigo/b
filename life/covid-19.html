title: current status of China

# current status of China
China has 829 million Internet users

# hideing cases?
Hide cases???
In China everyone could get test and free treatment
China has even counted asymptomatic cases extensively, If you are infected, they will track everyone you reach.
The U.S. approach is completely different —  If you are mildly infected, you will not be tested and will only go home to rest


# virus problem and hope
The pandemic is issue of the whole world wherever it originates

# faked news
Most westerners do not trust China’s measures, because they are brainwashed by too much faked and biased news(especially BBC, CNN, VOA, FOX and NYT). e.g. New York Times slammed for ‘too obvious’ double standards (http://en.people.cn/n3/2020/0312/c90000-9667680.html) 
Most people lose objective, unbiased sources of information and the ability to think critically. 
The pandemic is issue of the whole world wherever it originates.** no country can deal with it alone, and solidarity is the most powerful weapon. **


# hiding cases?
I really don’t understand why so many people blame Chind for Hiding info.
The question itself does not hold. 
China warned the world immediately when they realized it, and has been updating the information.

December 26 - Dr. Zhang Jixian in Wuhan encountered four patients with pneumonia different from other pneumonia.

December 27 - Dr. Zhang Jixian reported these cases to hospital leadership.

December 29 - After joint diagnosis, the hospital reported the disease to Wuhan CDC.

December 31 - China reported the unknown disease to WHO. Is that what you mean by “withholding information”?

January 3 - China reported the disease to other countries including the United States. Is that how someone “withhold information”?

It is worth mentioning that some countries like Singapore started implementing border restrictions immediately, and were able to protect their people.

January 5 - China isolated the strain, and identified 59 cases. On the same day, WHO released the news.

So, the American goverment had two months, and they did not do anything. Now, when an outbreak is right here, they started blaming China did not warn them. To make things worse, they keep telling people wearing face masks is not helpful; they insist the disease is not infectious during incubation period, while China has already informed them of the fact; they keep claiming it is just flu, while China and WHO have already told them it is very serious.

Some Americans now feel the information is hidden, because it is hidden by American government, who, most likely, is simply ignorant, and CNNs, who intentionally or unintentionally, did not report it.

# Blame China?
Pandemic is an issue of the whole world, like H1N1 and HIV
https://www.quora.com/Why-is-China-blaming-the-USA-for-coronavirus

# China&#x27;s Action
So far, this is what the evidence indicates:

(Note: I have posted these comparisons elsewhere on Quora, but they are worth repeating, as others are coming to the same conclusions.)

China quickly locked down the entire city of Wuhan. And later they locked down the entire province. We did not lock down a single country until MONTHS after the outbreak.

China issued masks and required everyone to wear them. We did not.

China built new hospitals in record time. We did not.

China tested everyone. We did not.

China forced isolation in government facilities for everyone with so much as a fever. We did not.

China patrolled the streets, spraying disinfectant everywhere. We did not.
