# 语法总原则
怎样学好英语语法？
https://www.zhihu.com/question/24485886/answer/54300952
你有什么相见恨晚的英语学习方法
https://www.zhihu.com/question/26677313/answer/104942176
语法分析：
https://www.zhihu.com/question/30030877/answer/770673948

# 句子结构
按结构分：
1. 简单句(Simple Sentences)：主谓/SVO/SVC/SVOO/SVOC
2. 并列句(Compound Sentences): He likes ..., but he do not ....
3. 复合句(Complex Sentences): 包含从句，The file had began, when we got to the cinema.

## 简单句的五种基本句型(Basic Sentence Patterns)
S:subject 主语 V:verb. 动词 O:object 宾语 C:Complement 补语(adj./noun.) P:Predication 表语

1. 主谓：S+V 主+谓(不及物) Birds fly.
2. 主谓宾：S+V+O 主+谓(及物)+宾 He plays the piano.
4. S+V+O+O 主+谓+间宾+直宾 I give you a hat
5. S+V+O+C 主+谓+宾+补  You make me happy
3. 主谓补: SVC(包括动词补语，和主系表SVP) He looks happy, We are students.

### 主谓补SVC
常见的SVC 有动词补语、主系表SVP(主语补语)
补语是句子核心成分不可省略

#### 动词补语
动词补语被动语态(谓补)：S + be + 过去分词 + C补(n./adj./P.O.)

    1. The Ship was named Elizabeth.
    2. He was called outrageous.
    3. His answer is deemed of the point.

SVi 结构如果要加宾语的话，需要在SVi后面加上介名词即P.O.结构(Preposition)，有两种理解:

    SVi + P.O. = SVtO 相当于主谓宾(Vi+介词构成的及物Vt)
    He + looked after+ me
    SVi + P.O. = SViC (介宾做补语)
    He + looked + after me.

&gt; 并非所有SVi+P.O. 都可理解为补语。E.g. He sleeps on the bed 中的on the bed 是介宾短语做状语，状语(adverbial modifier)是非核心部分可以省略，语义不会有*重大*的变化

#### 主系表
系动(linking verb)不表动作，仅起连接作用，后面的主语补语又被称为表语
- 表状态：be/feel/look/sound/taste/smell/seem/appear
The door was closed. 表状态
- 表状态转变：become/grow/get/turn/fall/go/come
The leaf will turn yellow in autumn.
- 表状态保持:continue/remain/stay/keep
The weather continued fine for several days(for 介词状语)

### SVOO vs SVOC
OO 中两O是不同的；OC中C是O是性质或状态，可用be连接
He gives me a gift。这里，me≠gift，所以是SVOO
They chose me the representitive for the committe.这里me = representitive,所以是SVOC

It is silly of us to believe him. 我们真蠢，相信了他
It is very kind of you to help us. (to help 是补语)
It seemed selfish of him not to give us anything.

# 句子成份
“我学英语”： “我”是主语，“学”是谓语，“英语”是宾语。
“苦逼的我学英语”：“苦逼的”是定语。(广义形容词)
“苦逼的我努力学英语”“努力地”是状语修饰动词“学”(广义副词) 
“苦逼的我努力学英语学了很多年” “学了很多年”是补语。

## 主语 subject
### 主谓一致
遵守一般原则就好，不用搞得那么复杂：谓动与主语单复数一致
### 代词
代词=名词/形容词

### 限定词与定语
限定词+定语+名词 可构成主语
限定词：
- 冠词(定冠a/an,不定冠the,0冠)
- 形容词物主限定:my,your,their,one&#x27;s,its,his
- 名词物主限定:mine,yours,theirs,one&#x27;s,its,his
- 名词属格:John&#x27;s
- 指示限定词this,that,these,those,such
- 疑问限定词:what,which,whose
- 不定限定词:no,some,any,each,every,enough,either,neither,all, both,half,serveral,many,much,(a)few,(a)little,other,another
- 基数词、序数词、倍数词、分数词
- 量词: a lot of,lots of,plenty of,a great deal of,a large amount of,a good number of


#### 定语, attribute
定语修饰名语的
1. 形容词做定语: 前置或后置

    a big apple
    something blue
     My book    代词作前置定语
     few women workers 少量女工 形容词、名词作前置定语
     The workers here come from Sichuan. 这里的工人来自四川。（副词作后置定语）
     a report on modern science.有关现代科学的报告。（介词短语作后置定语）
     8、The boy playing the piano 弹钢琴的男孩。（现在分词短语作后置定语）
     9、The dormitory built last year .去年盖的宿舍。（过去分词短语作后置定语）
     10、This is the new dictionary which I bought yesterday.这就是我昨天买的新字典。（定语从句作后置定语）

     冠词+新旧+大小+颜色+形状+材料+n.
     Small round wooden table
     中国当代优秀作家
     优秀+时代+国
     outstanding contemporary Chinese writer.
     国际经济新秩序
     新旧+国家+领域+n.
     New international economic order

2. 名词作定语(相当于形容词,或者两名词看作整体)
apple tree
trade war

3. 介宾短语后置定语, P.O., prepositional object phrase/freɪz/
a cat on the table(P.O.)

4. 非谓语动词(后置)

    something to eat
    the wall painted white
    the man standing by the window
    
5. 定语从句后置
a girl that is beautiful...
6. 介宾作后置定语
The transition *on a mountain slope* is often ....

### A of B 作主语
A 为名词： zone of transition 
A 为数量：a lot of ，a great number of

## 介宾(状、补)
介词+名词=P.O.介宾短语 (做状语、补语)

    主+谓+宾+补
    状从+主从(定从)+谓+宾从(定从)+补从
    状从+主从(定从)+谓(补从)

## 状语，adverial 
状语（adverbial）是用来修饰(modifier)、限制谓语（动词或形容词）的语言单位，
以表明*谓语*（动词或形容词）的*状态、方式、时间、处所或程度*等。
*可省略状语*,不会句子语义不会有重大变化,只是广义副词而已

    状语+动词/形容词/副词/整个句子
    *At the upper timberline* the trees begin to become twisted and deformed.(扭曲和变形)
    He sleeps *on the bed*.

## 补语Complement
补语Complement 的作用对象是*主语和宾语*. 主补=表语(Predication)

### 表语, Predication modifier
表语其实一种主语的补语，描述*主语的状态*属性

    The cat is *on the table*.
    He looks happy
    He is happy.
    系动词后的成分叫主语补足语，语法上称表语
    
### 动词补语(谓补)
参考句子结构
SVi+P+O = S Vi C
My father looked *after me*

### 形容词补语
I am happy *for you*.

## 四、谓语
### 谓语构成
谓语动词=助动词+实义动词=操作词(第一个助动)+其他助动+实义动词
- 否定:操作词+not+实义
- 一般疑问:操作+主语+实义动词
- 特殊疑问:特殊疑问+操作+主语+(其它助动词+)实义动词

关于动词:
1. 助动词是帮助实义动词传达意义的动词，只有18个，属于封闭词类
2. 操作词(operator) 并非与名词、动词具有相等地位，而是第一助动的特殊称谓。
3. 特殊疑问词分：代词性和副词性. 如果代词性自己做主语，
结构:特殊疑问+操作+(其它助动词+)实义动词. What is going on?

关于例子: I love you.
1. I do not love you.
2. Do I love you?
3. Why Do I love you?

I have been loving you for a long time:
1. I have not been loving you ....
2. Have I been loving you...
3. Why have I been loving you...

### 助动词
18个：
1. 基本3: be do have
2. 情态13: can/could, may/might, will/would, shall/should, must,
ought to, dare,need,used to
3. 半助动2: have to, seem to

### 16种时态与助动词
16 种时态, 时态与时间两个维度： 
![](/img/eng/eng-tense-and-auxiliary-verbs.png)

                过去             过去的将来               现在              将来
    一般        did/did do      would do                do                will do
    进行        was doing       would be doing          be doing          will be doing
    持续进行     had been doing  would have been doing   have been doing  will have been doing
    完成        had done        would have done         have done         will have done

*关于两个维度*
1. 实义动词区分时态:do 是一般(does/did)，doing是进行，done是完成
2. 操作词区分时间:will将来，现在时有do和be(am/is/are),过去将来用would,过去时可以有did、be(was/were)、have作为操作词，过去的过去一定以had打开

*关于助动词并用*
1. 三个基本助动be/do/have的组合只有have/had been doing两种(doing是实义), 除此之外只能用一种。
2. 情态助动will/would: 能接be/have,不能接助动do(will do中的do是实义动)
3. 另外，在实际使用中will/would 可能被其他情态助动词和半助动词代替:
might be doing, must have done, have to be doing, seem to have done等

#### 一般式
一般现在: do
1. China *is* a big country. 一般描述
2. The earth *rotates* on its axis. 客观存在
3. Percy *goes* to his office by underground every day.习惯动作

一般过去: did
1. Hilter&#x27;s army *invaded*(侵略) Russia in order to ... 一般描述
2. I *got up* at 6:00 every day in high school.

一般过去将来时: would do, 表过去时间对未来意愿或猜想
1. The South *would win* the battle under cruel slavery.
2. He knew he *would see* her before he death.

一般将来：will do
1. China *will launch* its own rockets with astronauts onto the moon.

#### 进行时
现在进行时: is doing
1. Sb. *is taking* measures to control housing prices.

过去进行时：was doing
3. The plane *was flying* over my head last midnight.

将来进行时:will be doing
1. Facebook users *will be demonstrating* their desire for privacy outside its headquarters.
 
过去将来进行时:would be doing
1. when I was small, Grandpa said I *would be fighting* for my future 20 years later.
2. She said she *would be setting* off on the 10 o&#x27;clock train

#### 完成时
现在完成: has/have done st.
China has carried out its opening-up policy for decades.

过去完成：对过去有影响, had done st.
过去的过去完成的动作
1. She *had finished* her graduate school, so she could start working in the fall of 2016
2. She must have finished her.... (must have done 即表现在完成，也表过去完成)

现在-完成-进行时：have been doing

过去完成进行时: had been doing
She *had been carrying out* her plot to be the queen three month earlier.

将来完成进行时: will have been doing

过去将来完成时: would have done
I guessed that Helen *would have told* her something.

### 2种语态
主动语态就是上面16种，现在看16种被动语态
![](/img/eng/eng-passive-verb-tense.png)

    do -&gt; be done
    doing -&gt; being done
    done -&gt; been done
              过去                  过去的将来                  现在                  将来
    一般      was/were done        would be done              is/are done           will be done
    进行      was/were being done  would be being done        be being done         will be being done
    持续进行   had been being done  would have been being done have been being done  will have been being done
    完成      had been done        would have been done       have been done         will have been done

### 3种语气
陈述语气:陈述问、疑问问、感叹句
祈使语气：祈使句
虚拟语气:表达愿望、建议或与事实或预期相反的假设


## 定语
### 定语从句：
New York is the place *that he would like to visit*. 纽约是他想去游览的地方。

### 介词短语定语：
The girl **in red** is my sister. 穿红色那个女孩是我的妹妹。

### 非谓语动词定语：
1. the girl **standing** there=the girl who is standing there. 站在那的女孩
1. the building **completed** yesterday=the building that was completed yesterday.

## 状语
&gt; 作者：英语老师Monica https://www.zhihu.com/question/30030877/answer/768501967

### 名词状:  
come **this way**.

### 副词状: 
speak **politely**.

### 介词短语状：
Can you say it `in English`.

### 状语从句
：I enjoyed myself `when I visited my friends in Shanghai last year`.

### 非谓语动词状语
非谓动词包括：to do, doing, done

非谓作状语e.g.
1. `Having finished the homework`, I went home.
2. `Given more time`, I could write the essay better.
3. `To give the teacher a good impression`, I decided  to help her.

### 状语复杂化
此句是错误的，因为一个句子只能有一个动词，这里面有两个动词:

    There are many lovers become the strangers finally

那该如何改有三种改法。
1. There are many lovers `and` they become the strangers finally(并列连词）
2. There are many lovers `who become the strangers finally`(从句）
3. There are many lovers `becoming the strangers finally`(非谓语动词）

e.g:
During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on hard work and fair play to keep itself financially secure has been transformed by economic risk and new realities.
过去靠辛勤劳动和公平竞争可以保证收入安全的中产，已经被金融危机和现实所改变

# 五、非谓语(独立主格)
非谓语：没有不定式、也没有分词等形式. 可用作定语、状语
逻辑主语与主句的*主语相同*，省略主谓:
(S + V1) +(S + V2) = S + V1 and V2
(S + V1) +(S + be + X) = S + V1, X

    X = 非谓语动词
        to do
        doing
        done
        n.

其中X常见:to do,doing,done 三种*非谓语形式*. 下面会描述的

X还可以扩展到*非动词性成分*, 这时不能称为非谓语动词：
1. n.
Confucius taught us that… + Confucius was a great philosopher.
--&gt; Confucius, a great philosopher（同位语）, taught us that…
2. adj. 
We naively believed that… + We were young and foolish.
--&gt; We, young and foolish（可视为后置定语或定语从句的省略）, naively believed that…
(the Depart of State is)Equivalent to the foreign ministry of other countries, the Department of State is responsible for ....
(Tom is) Eager to prove himself, Tom signed up for the marathon
(Lisa&#x27;s Dad is)Satisfied with her answer, Lisa&#x27;s dad let her off the hook. (放过她、不追究了）
3. P.O.
People tend to behave hastely. + People are in such a situation.--&gt; People in such a situation（后置定语） tend to behave hastely./ People tend to behave hastely in such a situation（状语）.
4. adv.
I now announce the opening of… + I am here.
--&gt; Here（状语修饰announce）, I now announce the opening of…

## 1. to do不定式作非谓语
表将来
1. to do: It is about *to fall*. 
表目的
2. to do: We come here *to study*. = We come here.+We are to study.
## 2. doing现在分词
表主动伴随状态

## 3. done 过去分词
表被动伴随状态
Scrached by the cat, the boy cried. = The boy was scrached by the cat, the boy cried.

## 4. 独立主格(主语不同)
独立主格的逻辑主语与句子的*主语不同*，独立存在, 只省略了系动不省略主语:

    (S1+V1) + (S2 + be + X) = S1 + V1. S2+X

1. He came out of the library, a large book is under his arm.
2. He came out of the library, (with) a large book under his arm.
他夹了本厚书走出了图书馆。
3. （When）The test finished, we began our holiday.

独立主格可带with: (with +) 逻辑主语+其它成份
    He stood there, his hand raised.
    He stood there, *with* his hand raised.

### 不定式独立主格表将来
1. His friends *to come* tonight, he is busy preparing the dinner.
2. We shall assemble at ten, the procession *to start* moving at precisely eleven.
3. Here are the first two volumes, the third one *to come out* next month.
4. The two boys said goodbye to each other, one *to go* home, and the other *to go* to his friends.

### 现在分词表进行或主动
1. The boy *leading* the way, we had no trouble getting out of the forest.

3. The rain *having stopped*, he went out for a walk.

### 过去分词独立主格表：完成或被动

2. Her work *done*, she sat down for a cup of tea.
3. &quot;Marquis&quot;, said the boy, turing to the man, his eyes *opened* wide and his right hand *raised*.

2. Man people come to visit the city, most of them *foreigners*.
3. He fought the wolf, a stick *his only weapon*.
4. It *Sunday*, we went to church.

### 形容词独立主格
1. He turned to me, his eyes sleepy.
2. The men moved slowly forward, neck deep in the water, with their officers *guiding* them.
3. It stood silent in the noon sunlight, its door *open*.
4. He came into the room, his ears *red* with cold.

### 介词短语独立主格
1. School *over*, we all went home.
2. Nobody *in*, the thief took a lot of things away.
3. Music *on*, I can&#x27;t focus my mind on the work.
4. The huters entered the forest, gun *in hand*.

The old man, *with thick glasses on his nose*, is a pianist.

# 复合句 + 复杂句

    复合句=简单句1+复合连词+简单句2
    复杂句=简单句1+代词/副词/连词+简单句2

https://www.zhihu.com/question/31730389/answer/53104347?group_id=602183152467374080

## 杂项及长难句分析

    学外语是要学语法的
    英语语法是有体系的
    语法总原则：一个句子有且仅有一个谓语动词
    句子分为简单句、复合句、复杂句
    简单句=主语+谓语=主语+谓语动词+其他成分=主语+助动词+实义动词+其他成分
    主语一般是名词词组，名词词组=限定词+定语+名词
    谓语动词=助动词+实义动词=操作词+其他助动词+实义动词
    谓语动词有16种时态，2种语态，3种语气
    非谓语动词=谓语动词阉割掉助动词be的形式，可以做除谓语动词之外的所有成分
    复合句=简单句1+复合连词+简单句2
    复杂句=简单句1+代词/副词/连词+简单句2

数学公式化表达

    简单句=S+P=S + V + ...（P代表Predicate谓语）
    S=NP=限定词+定语+n.=大定语+n.（NP代表noun phrase）
    V=Aux + v. = operator + other Aux + V.
    S + V + ... = SVtO或SVi或SVC或SVoO或SVOC
    带从句的句子=主句+从句=简单句1+引导词+简单句2
    非谓语动词：(S + V1) +(S + be + X) = S + V1, X
    独立主格：(S1 + V1) + (S2 + be + X) = S1 + V1, S2 + X

# 句子种类
## 按使用目的分
1. 陈述句（declarative sentences）：Light travel faster than sound.
2. 疑问句(Interrogative Sentences):
    一般疑问(General Questions),
    特殊疑问句(H Questions),
    选择疑问句(Alternative questions): Do you like coffee or tea?
    反意疑问句(Tag-Questions): He doesn&#x27;t know her, does he?
3. 祈使句(Imperative Sentences): Do sth./Let sb. do sth./ Shall sb. do sth.
    Sit down, please.
4. 感叹句(Exclamatory Sentences):
    How + adj.(a n.可数) + 陈述主谓
        How cleaver (a boy) he is!

    What + n.(可数或不可数) + (陈述)
        What a cleaver boy (he is)!
        What good news it is!

5. 强调句: It is + 强调部分+ that/who + 句子. (或用do强调，Please do take care of yourself!)

# 虚拟语气, subjunctive mood
在英语中有三种语气：陈述语气(陈述疑问感叹)，祈使语气和虚拟语气。
There are three kinds of mood in english: the *indicative* mood, the *imperative* mood and the *subjunctive* mood.

虚拟语气表主观愿望、假想的一个条件(非真实条件)，不一定是事实。

* 真实条件
If you leave now, you will never regret it.
If he comes, he will bring his violins

虚拟语气则是 非真实条件
https://www.zhihu.com/question/23983035
一般是if 条件状语从句, 名词性从句，...。

## 虚拟语气状语从句主句模板:

- 过去：had done, would + have done
- 现在：did/were, would + do/be doing
- 将来: 
    did/were,   would + do/be doing
    were to do, would + do/be doing
    should do, would + do/be doing    
&gt; 主句除了用would，还有might/could/should

* 与现在事实相反
一般过去时, should/would + 原形
If they were here, they would help you.

* 与过去事实相反的假设
过去完成时, should/would have + 过去分词
If she had worked harder, she would have succeeded.
The rice would not have been burnt if you had been more careful.

* 表示对将来的预期相反(不是与事实相反，而是对将来正常情况的反向虚拟)
If you succeeded, everyting would be all right.(与现在或将来相反)
If you should succeed, everyting would be all right.
If you were to succeed, everyting would be all right.

&gt; Should we decide to take your application further
should 在这里不是“应该”的意思，而是虚拟语气+省略if. 比如：
If I should meet her, I would tell her.=Should I meet her, I would tell her.

### 理解虚拟语气
https://www.zhihu.com/question/23983035
虚拟语气：表愿望、建议、与事实或预期相反的假设， 如果if...就不会/会..。换成if only(但愿)等价，反过来如果能用if only的都是虚拟语气.

if only I were rich! 但愿我很有钱
If only I had listened to you!
要是我听你的就好了

### 名词性状语从句中的虚拟语气subjunctive
表意见、命令、要求的动/名词+that +(should)+动原:

#### 常用动词
advise/suggest/insist/request/odder/demand/decide/recommend等
1. Jane&#x27;s uncle insist that she (should) not stay in the hotel.坚决要求
2. The workers requested that their working conditions (should) be improved.

#### 常用名词
